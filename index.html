                <h3>Modification of Hardware</h3>
                <p>I am able to modify both the hardware and software of many devices. It usually depends on the age, brand, and software version of the device, but in most cases things like bypassing software locks, adding themes or disabling telemetry
                    is something I can do.</p>

            <p>Hi! I'm Nick. I'm an 18 year old Computer Science student currently enrolled at York University in Toronto. My interest with technology started when I was very young, and it's something that has shaped me into who I am today. I am fascinated
                by all things technology, both with software and hardware. I love learning how to program and create new things whether it be for myself or for others. I also really enjoy taking apart tech and seeing what makes it tick (even if it's at
                the cost of its warranty). I am an avid supporter of <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/lets-get-right-to-repair-passed">Right to Repair</a> and letting consumers make their own choices on who should be able to repair their devices, whether
                it be the manufacturer, a local repair shop or themselves. Not only is Right to Repair meant to give consumers more power over the devices they spent their money on, it also allows less perfectly good devices from ending up in landfills
                just because the battery is bad, the screen is cracked, et cetera.</p>
