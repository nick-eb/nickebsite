    <div class="description">
        <p>FunkiniOS was a product of immense boredom, wanting to learn Haxe (the language Friday Night Funkin' is programmed in) and wanting to be able to say I 'made' an iOS app, but most importantly it was made out of love; the love that I have for games
            that remind me of older Flash games from the early to late 2000's. </p>

        <p>Some cool things I did to get Friday Night Funkin' running on iDevices was configuring some manual and some automatic scaling options to make the assets load and look proper, as the game is meant to be played at a fixed resolution, whereas my
            port dynamically resizes to the size of the device it is being played on. I added on-screen controls so you can play using your touch screen (although it definitely is harder to play that way!)</p>
        <p>Finally, I also manually resized and compressed a large chunk of the assets in the game. This was the most herculean task, but also the most important task to get the game working at all on devices older than the iPhone XS. The way Haxe deals
            with texture atlases is not super efficient in terms of RAM usage, and iPhones are notorious for low amounts of RAM. Pretty early on I realized that would be a problem. I'd say a good 60% or so of the work I did in the port was exclusively
            spent trying to lower RAM usage as much as humanely possible. I reduced RAM usage quite substantially so that devices as old as the iPhone 7 with 2GB of RAM can play.</p>
